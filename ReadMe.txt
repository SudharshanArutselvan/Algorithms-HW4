Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's Algorithm

Commands to run the program

1. make minimum-spanning-tree
2. ./minimum-spanning-tree path_to_file/filename

If the input file is dense_100000.txt and the file is in the same 
folder then, the command is ./minimum-spanning-tree dense_100000.txt

If the input file is dense_100000.txt and the file is in another folder inside the program folder
named "files" then, the command is ./minimum-spanning-tree files/dense_100000.txt

If the input file is dense_100000.txt and file is in a folder not in the program folder
then, the command is ./minimum-spanning-tree /path to folder/dense_100000.txt
