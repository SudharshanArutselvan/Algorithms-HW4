Edit Distance

Commands to run the program

1. make edit-dist
2. ./edit-dist path_to_file/filename

If the input file is sample.txt and the file is in the same 
folder then, the command is ./edit-dist sample.txt

If the input file is dense_100000.txt and the file is in another folder inside the program folder
named "files" then, the command is ./edit-dist files/sample.txt

If the input file is dense_100000.txt and file is in a folder not in the program folder
then, the command is ./edit-dist /path to folder/sample.txt

Here in this folder all the files are in the same location hence the first example will work!

The output for all the inputs will be stored in another text file named
"source-filename_output.txt"
The output files will be created in the same location as the input file.

The output file for the question 1(qn1_input.txt) will contain various operations done and the string after each operation
The output file for the input1, input2 and input3 text files will contain the strings used and the edit distance.
